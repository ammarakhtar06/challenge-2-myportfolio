            <h2 class="h2"> About Me</h2>
            <p class="paragraph"> Hi my name is Mohammed Ammar Akhtar. My preferred name is Ammar. I am currently
                enrolled at the "Full-Stack" Coding Bootcamp at UCLA. Upon completion I have
                hope of workign as a Software Engineer in tech. My journey to the coding world
                is quite unique. I have no back ground with coding, computer, or any technical
                skills. As I've matured I've come to realization technology is and always has
                been the future, and to be unskilled was no longer an option in a hyper-technological
                world. A little backgorund about me, I have been working for Car Trackers, mobil turned
                digital car buying service for the last 9 years. Even in my role as a "Purchasing Manager" I
                witnessed the shift from "door-to-door" sales approach to a digital one. Aside from my new
                found passion for coding and my work life I enjoy spending time with family and friends, and
                eating good food.
